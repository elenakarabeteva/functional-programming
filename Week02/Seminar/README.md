# Task 1
A number is a palindrome if and only if it is the same number from right to left as well as from left to right. Define a predicate that checks whether a non-negative number is a palindrome.

# Task 2
Define a recursive function for calculating the sum of the digits of a whole number.

# Task 3
Define a recursive and an iterative function for calculating `x` to the power of `n`, where `x` is a floating-point number and `n` is non-negative.

# Task 4
A prime number is a natural number greater than `1` that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

# Task 5
Define a function that returns the sum of the divisors of a non-negative number.

# Task 6
A number - `n`, is perfect if and only if it is natural and equal to the sum of its divisors that are less than `n`. Define a predicate that checks whether a number is perfect.

# Task 7
Define a predicate that checks whether the digits of a non-negative whole number are ordered in an ascending order.
