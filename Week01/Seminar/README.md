# Task 1
Define functions that return:

- the smaller of two whole numbers:
  - add a test with negative numbers;
  - using if-else;
  - using guards;
  - using a built-in function.
- the last digit of a number
- the quotient of the division of two whole numbers
- the quotient and remainder of the division of two whole numbers
- a whole number without its last digit
- the quotient and remainder of the division of two real numbers
- the quotient of the division of two real numbers
- the average of two whole numbers
- the number rounded to the second digit after the `.`


# Task 2
Define a predicates that check:

- whether two numbers are not equal:
  - in one line without using if-else;
  - using guards.
- whether a whole number x is between two whole numbers - start and finish in one line without using if-else.


# Task 3
Define a recursive and an iterative function for calculating the factorial of a non-negative number.

- solve with a linearly recursive process;
- solve using a linearly iterative process.


# Task 4
Define a recursive and an iterative function for calculating the number at index i in the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...).

> Implementation detail: The input will always be valid, i.e. greater than -1.
