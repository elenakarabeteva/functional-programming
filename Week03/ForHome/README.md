# Task 1
Define a function that removes **the first** occurrence of a digit in a number by going from right to left.


# Task 2
Define a function that sorts a number in descending order.


# Task 3
Define a function that accepts two real numbers and calculates the `n`-th partial sum.


# Task 4
Define a function `sumDivisibleNumbers start finish k` that returns the sum of all numbers from the interval [`start`, `finish`] whose digits sum up to a number that is evenly divisible by `k`.

> **Implementation detail**: Create a linearly recursive process.


# Task 5
A number - `x`, is a pentagonal number if we can plot `x` poits in the form of a pentagon on a plain.

Define a function that accepts a natural number - `n`, and returns the `n`-th pentagonal number.

> **Implementation detail**: Create a linearly iterative process.
