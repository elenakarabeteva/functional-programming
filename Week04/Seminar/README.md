# Task 1
Define predicates that check whether a list has at least one element.

Implementation details:

    - Solve using pattern matching.
    - Solve using functions.
    - Solve using a function defined at a functional level.


# Task 2
Write functions that return the number of elements in a list.

Implementation detail:

    - Solve using a linearly recursive process WITHOUT pattern matching.
    - Solve using a linearly recursive process WITH pattern matching.
    - Solve using functions.


# Task 3
Write a function that generates a list made up of the numbers in the interval `[x, y]`.

Implementation details

    - Solve using recursion.
    - Solve the task in one line of code.


# Task 4
Write a predicate that checks whether a number `n` is between two numbers - `x` and `y`.

> **Implementation detail**: Solve the task in one line of code using lists.


# Task 5
Write a function that removes the first element in a list that is equal to `x` by going from left to right.


# Task 6
Write a function that removes every element equal to `x` in a list.

Implementation details:

    - Solve using recursion.
    - Solve using higher order functions.


# Task 7
Write a function increments all the values in a list by a given number.

Implementation details:

    - Solve using list comprehension.
    - Solve using higher order functions.


# (❗❗) Task 8 (❗❗)

In **ONE** line of code:

- Reverse a number;
- Calculate the factorial of a number;
- Check whether a number is prime;
- Returns the sum of the digits of a number;
- Find the sum of the divisors of a number;


# Task 9
Define a function that returns the prime numbers in the range (x, y) that contain the digit 7.

    - Solve using list comprehension in ONE line of code.
    - Solve using higher order functions in ONE line of code.
